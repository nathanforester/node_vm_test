# Vagrant provision class :taco:

Today's learning objectives:
- provisioning 
- setting up a working app



### Sudo code of what we want to do: 

#### Question you might ask
Someone from the team is hadding you code. Don't just accpet, ask for context. Examples:
- what language
- what frameworks?
- are there tests? 
- is a specific package that need to be installed? is the a package list of some sort? 
- specific versions?
- specific packages or versions that don't work? 
- any other info? 

##### response you got today!
- amazing <person> thank you for asking! Well we have a good readme.
- it's all built on js node (ohhh okay look out for this terminology)
- and there are some test you can run from the host machine. 
- just bundle install and run the rake file! (smile)

I want to create machine and set up a work app in it. 
I want it in a VM because it will be a standardize environment.

What steps do I need to take?

Well I know the enviroment will be: 
- ubuntu/xenial64 (done)
- I will need nodejs 
- check how to install stuff in it (the dependencies)
- I want it on port 80
- I will need a reverse proxy to get my app talking on port 80 
- I will need my app in my vm! (right?) so I can install and run it's code
