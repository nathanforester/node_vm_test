#### Virtual Machines and creating standardised environments

### Before you begin:

- Ensure that you are running the most stable version of Ruby. The latest version may still have bugs or missing files. This can be easily found by looking at the link to download the software IN BOLD with some sort of indication next to it (a --> or some other pointer)

- Before you run the tests on your provision and vagrant file, ensure that the syntax used is operating system appropriate (before apt- commands on Linux or Mac, use 'sudo' - you do not use this command on Windows machines or tests will fail).

- Ensure nginx is initialised before starting these tests. 

- nginx will also need to be initiliased before creating your vm
